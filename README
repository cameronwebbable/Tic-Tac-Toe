Tic Tac Toe ... with some jQuery!
---------

This is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game entirely rendered and played in the browser with the help of jQuery. No server-side processing is necessary. 

A live demo is available at: http://cameronmwebb.com/tictactoe/tictactoe.html

How to set this up:
- Download the code from github
- Open "tictactoe.html" in your favorite browser
- Constantly fail trying to beat the AI.
